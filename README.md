## About the Project / Project Title
The CRUD Python Module now fully implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for MongoDB. In addition to inserting and retrieving documents, the module now supports updating documents (returning the number of modified documents) and deleting documents (returning the number of deleted documents). This design enables detailed tracking of database modifications and is built using industry best practices.

## Motivation
I developed this module to deepen my understanding of MongoDB and to practice implementing real-world CRUD operations using Python. With prior experience in setting up user authentication and database connections, I was excited to transfer that knowledge into a practical application. Overcoming challenges like ensuring a robust database connection, input validation, and error handling has been invaluable for my growth as a developer.

## Python Driver
This module uses the pymongo libraryâ€”the official MongoDB driver for Python. It was chosen for its comprehensive support for MongoDB features, active maintenance, and widespread community adoption.

## CRUD Operation Details
- **Create**: Accepts a non-empty dictionary to insert a new document into the specified collection.
- **Read**: Uses a provided query (or returns all documents if none is given) and returns a list of documents.
- **Update**: Accepts a query and an update dictionary; performs an update operation that modifies all matching documents and returns the count of modified documents.
- **Delete**: Accepts a query and removes all matching documents from the collection, returning the count of deleted documents.

## Getting Started
To help get started using the module, follow these steps:
1. Download the file provided with this documentation.
2. **MongoDB Connection**: The module connects to a MongoDB instance using the pymongo library. It uses default connection details (host, port, database, and collection) that you can override by providing your own credentials.
3. The connection uses environment variables (`MONGO_USER` and `MONGO_PASS`) or will prompt for input if these are not set.
4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` if available or simply run `pip install [missing_packages]`.
5. Import the module into your project with a typical Python import statement, for example:
   ```python
   from CRUDDriverMongoDB import CRUDDriverMongoDB
   ```

## Installation
Required tools and libraries:
- **Python 3.9** - available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **MongoDB**
- **pymongo**
- **bson**

These can be installed via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Mongoimport Tool Command
```bash
mongoimport --host nv-desktop-services.apporto.com --port 31580 -u aacuser -p SNHU1234 --authenticationDatabase AAC --db AAC --collection animals --type csv --file /usr/local/datasets/aac_shelter_outcomes.csv --headerline
```

## Usage
This module demonstrates how to perform full CRUD operations on a MongoDB collection. When you run the module, it will:
- **Prompt for** or use provided credentials to establish a connection with MongoDB.
- **Insert** a new document (for example, with fields such as name and species) into a specified collection (Create).
- **Retrieve** and display the inserted document in the console (Read).
- **Modify** existing documents by applying update operations based on a query. The module returns the number of documents that were updated (Update).
- **Remove** documents from the collection using a specified query, returning the count of documents deleted (Delete).

## Tools Used and Rationale
1. **MongoDB as the Model** - Chosen for its flexible schema, easy integration with Python, and ability to store complex JSON-like documents.
2. **Dash as the View/Controller** - Dash is a web framework for Python that seamlessly integrates interactive charts, tables, and components.
3. **Python 3.9 & pymongo** - Python is widely used for data manipulation and rapid prototyping. pymongo ensures compatibility and reliability.
4. **Additional Tools** - Jupyter Notebooks, Plotly Express, and dash_leaflet for maps and data visualization.

## Steps Taken to Complete the Project
1. Set Up MongoDB and imported data.
2. Developed CRUD Python Module with robust error handling.
3. Integrated Dash for interactive filtering and visualization.
4. Tested functionality using Jupyter Notebook and manual execution.
5. Refined layout and branding for a professional look.

## Challenges Encountered and How They Were Overcome
- **Base64 Image Encoding**: Initially failed to display; resolved by decoding properly.
- **Filtering Logic**: Adjusted DataFrame operations to ensure correct data selection.
- **Map Integration**: Ensured lat/lon values were valid and correctly formatted.
- **Callback ID Mismatches**: Fixed mismatches to enable Dash interactivity.

## Reflection
### 1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
Writing **modular and reusable** code is critical in software development. The CRUD Python module was built with **clear function separation, parameterization, and error handling**, ensuring it remains adaptable for future applications. Using this approach, the module integrates seamlessly into different projects, including Project Two's dashboard. **This module can be expanded further for broader database applications**, including automated reporting, logging systems, or API services.

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach
Approaching this project, I followed a structured **problem-solving strategy**:
- **Requirement Analysis**: I carefully reviewed Grazioso Salvare's specifications.
- **Database and Dashboard Design**: Ensured schema and filter logic aligned with client needs.
- **Incremental Development & Testing**: Implemented features step-by-step, testing at each stage.
- **Optimization & Debugging**: Addressed performance bottlenecks, map coordinate errors, and callback mismatches.

Compared to past assignments, this project emphasized **real-world software engineering** by requiring integration of **frontend, backend, and database operations**.

### 3. Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists **develop solutions that improve efficiency and automation**. This project helps Grazioso Salvare **organize and visualize rescue data dynamically**, allowing employees to:
- **Filter and analyze** rescue operations more effectively.
- **Quickly retrieve** key insights from MongoDB.
- **Improve decision-making** using a structured, visual interface.

These principles extend beyond this project into broader applications in **finance, healthcare, and logistics**, where efficient database management and visualization are crucial.
